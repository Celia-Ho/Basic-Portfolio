			<p>Hello! My name is Celia.  Welcome to my portfolio website.  Currently I am learning to code and it is very interesting.  I hope I will eventually have a lot of projects on display here.</p>

			<p>other than coding I have a lot of other hobbies and interests like watching movies, Youtubing and just relaxing. But coding is preventing me from doing a lot of those.  I hope coding will also become one of my favourite hobbies.</p>
